About Text:
My passion and drive for new technology, programming and the internet had let me though web development as an autodidact. After developing those skills and putting up some scaffold sites, I decided to put them online.
I want to offer my skills to solve real life problems, since its easy to put up some mockery but only the missions for real people is it really worth to excel.
Since I'm just a humble human, I decided to show just frontend solutions here, using technology as HTML5, CSS, jQuerry and Bootstrap, with more to come.
I dived into Node.js and Angular.js with some sidesteps into Ember.js and Backbone.js to offer full stack development later.
